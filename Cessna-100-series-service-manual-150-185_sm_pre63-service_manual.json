The Cessna single-engine aircraft described in this manual are similar in that all models are of a high-wing mono~ plane configuration, employing patented spring- steel main landing gear struts, opposed air-cooled Continental engines, and all-metal semi-monocoque airframe construction. Except for the Model 150 series aircraft, which have four-cylinder engines, these aircraft use six-cylinder engines. The Model 150 is two-place and all others except the Model 185 are four-place. The Model 185 is a multi-purpose aircraft, designed as a one-, two-, four-, or six- place aircraft. An auxiliary seat may be installed in most models. The Models 180 and 185 are equip- ped with tailwheels and the others have a tricycle- type landing gear. Beginning in 1960, Models 172, 175, and 182 series aircraft were designed witha",

The system consists of an electric motor driving a transmission that oper- ates the right flap drive pulley which is linked to the right flap. The right and left drive pulleys are in- terconnected by cables to insure duplicate motion of both flaps. The flap motor is controlled by a switch mounted in the instrument panel. Flap position is transmitted electrically to a flap position indicator.",

FUEL INJECTION SYSTEM. 12A-21, Fuel injection is standard equipment on all Model 185 aircraft. This fuel injection system is a simple, low pressure system of injecting fuel into the intake valve port in the cylinder head. It is a multi- nozzle, continuous flow type which controls fuel flow to match engine airflow. Any change in throttle posi- tion, engine speed, or a combination of both, causes changes in fuel flow in the correct relation to engine airflow. A manual mixture control and a fuel flow in- dicator are provided for leaning at any combination of altitude and power setting. The continuous flow system uses a typical rotary-vane fuel pump.

    "paragraph3883": "\"When synthetic rubber fuel cells are placed in service, the gasoline has a tendency to extract the plasticizer from the inner liner of the cell. This extraction of plasticizer is not detrimental as long as gasoline remains in the fuel cells, in as much as the gasoline itself will act as a suitable plasticizer. When the gasoline is drained from the fuel cell, the plasticizing effect of the gasoline is lost and the inner liner of the cell begins to dry out. Subse- quent cracking or checking will occur. This crack- ing or checking may penetrate through the inner liner, permitting gasoline to diffuse through wall of the cell after the cell has been refueled. To prevent this failure, a thin coating of light engine oil should be applied to the inner liner of all serv- iceable fuel cells, which have contained gasoline, when it ts evident that the cells will remain with- out fuel for more than ten days, whether installed in airplanes or in storage. The oil will act as a temporary plasticizer and will prevent the inner liner from drying out and cracking. If it becomes necessary to return the cell to the contractor or the vendor for testing or repair, do not allow quan- tities of oll to be puddled in the cell as it will make handling and repair much more difficult. Cells should be repacked as similar to the original factory pack as possible,\"",

The propeller governor is a single-acting, centrifugal type, which boosts oil pressure from the engine and directs it to the propeller where the oil is used to increase blade pitch of some propellers and to decrease blade pitch of others. A single-acting governor uses the oil pressure to effect a pitch change in one direction only; a pitch change in the opposite direction results from propeller counter- weights, centrifugal twisting moment of blades, compressed springs, or a combination of some of these. Oil pressure is boosted in the governor by",

On early Woodward governors and governors manufactured by Hoof Products Company, \"sensing\" is determined by the location of a by-pass plug. On later Wood- ward governors, as well as early ones which have been reworked, \"sensing\" is determined by the type pilot valve installed inside the governor. Refer to figure 14-6 for proper location of plugs on Woodward and Hoof governors. A McCauley propeller with a Garwin governor is the only combination used on the Model 175 (1962 and on).",

PITOT AND STATIC SYSTEM MAINTENANCE, Proper maintenance of the pitot and static system is essential for the proper operation of the altimeter, and vertical speed and airspeed indicators. Leaks, moisture and obstructions in the pitot system will result in false airspeed indications, while static sys- tem malfunctions will affect the readings of all three instruments. Under instrument flight conditions, these instrument errors could be hazardous. Clean- liness and security are the principal rules for pitot and static pressure system maintenance. Both the pitot tube and the static ports must be kept clean and unobstructed.",
    "paragraph4612": "16-13. ALIGNING PITOT TUBE. For correct air- speed indications the pitot tube on the 150, 172 and 175 series must be properly aligned, so that the open end of the tube is perpendicular to the vertical axis and parallel to the longitudinal axis of the air- plane. For the 172 and 175, a template like the one shown in figure 16-3 will prove the most convenient means of checking this alignment. Fit the template over the wing leading edge and bend the tube if nec- essary so that its contour falis along the pitot tube line on the template. The tube should parallel a straightedge placed along the row of wing rib rivets just outboard of the tube. The pitot tube on the 150 likewise should parallel the row of wing rib rivets. Its contour should be checked with a template made to the pattern in figure 16-4. The template fits over the leading edge of the wing and the pitot tube should parallel one of the straight lines on the template. Both illustrations of pitot tube contour templates have been drawn carefully to actual size, so that they may be traced directly on a sheet of stiff plastic, plywood or metal. Place a piece of carbon paper be- tween the printed page and the template material and trace the contours.",
    "paragraph4613": "16-14. CHECKING FOR LEAKS. To check the pitot system for leaks, fasten a piece of rubber or plastic tubing over the pitot tube, close the opposite end of the tubing and slowly roll up the tube until the air- speed indicator registers in the cruise range. Se- cure the tube and after a few minutes recheck the airspeed indicator. Any leakage will have reduced the pressure in the system, resulting in a lower airspeed indication. Slowly unroll the tubing before removing it, so the pressure is reduced gradually. Otherwise the instrument may be damaged. [If the test reveals a leak in the system, check all connec- tions for tightness. On some airplanes, the pitot system includes a rubber hose connection at the wing root rib, Pay particular attention to this connection when checking the system for security; if the hose shows signs of deterioration, replace it.",

To remove the pitot mast on models with this type system, remove the four mounting screws on the side of the attaching connector and pull the mast out of the connector far enough to disconnect the pitot line. Electrical connections to the heater assembly (if installed) may be disconnected through the wing access opening just inboard of the mast. On airplanes having the simple metal pitot tube, the tube connection is accessible through the access hole just inboard of the pitot tube. To remove the pitot tube, disconnect the fitting and pull the tube out of the wing through the access hole. The pitot and static lines are removed in the usual manner, after removing the wing access openings, lower wing fairing strip, decorative cover over the left door- post, and when necessary, the left forward uphol- stery panel. Reinstallation of the wing line will be simpler if a guide wire is drawn in as the line is re- moved from the wing. The wing line may be remov- ed intact by drawing it out through the cabin and right cabin door,",

When replacing components of the pitot and static pressure systems, use anti-seize compound sparingly on the male threads on both metal and plastic connections. Avoid excess com- pound which might enter the lines. Tighten con- nections firmly, but avoid overtightening and dis- torting the fittings.

All other aircraft have vacuum pump provisions. Except for the suction source, the two systems are similar. The engine- driven vacuum system uses a vacuum pump mounted on the engine accessory case or the engine case. The pump is gear-driven through a spline-type coupling. The vacuum pump discharge is through an oil sepa- rator, where the oil, which passes through the pump and lubricates it, is returned to the engine sump and the air is expelled overboard.

Add distilled water as necessary to maintain the electrolyte level with the horizontal baffle plate or the split ring on the filler neck inside the battery. When \"dry charged\" batteries are put into service fill as directed with electrolyte. When the electrolyte level falls below normal with use, add only distilled water to maintain the proper level.

The generator output is controlled by the current passing thru the field winding of the generator. The field winding is connected to the armature circuit of the generator internally and must be grounded externally (by the regulator) for the generator to operate. The generator is driven either by a gear train in the engine accessory case or by a V-belt, The output is 14 volts at 20, 35 or 50 amperes, depending upon the particular unit. ‘three electrical connections are required for the generator. Ground is provided thru the generator case and mounting brackets. The field terminal is connected thru the master switch to the voltage regulator and the armature terminal connects di- rectly to the voltage regulator. On some aircrait a capacitor is attached to the armature terminal of the generator. The capacitor suppresses any radio inter- ference which might be created by the generator.",

The voltage and current limiting relays control the output of the generator according to the demand of the battery. This control of the generator is accom- plished by changing the amount of field current flow- ing through the generator. The maximum current out- put of the generator is controlled by the current limit- ing relay. If the current output of the generator ex- ceeds a preset amount the current limiting relay inter- rupts the generator field circuit reducing the output by inserting a resistance into the field circuit. Similar conditions apply for generator output voltage control. When the generator is not producing, such as in an idle condition it is necessary to disconnect the battery from the generator. If the generator is not discon-",

To prevent this loss of battery potential the cutout relay portion of the regulator disconnects the battery from the armature circuit when the charging voltage drops below a specified level and current begins to flow in a reverse direction. The operation of the voltage regulator controls the output of the generator with respect to certain preset maximum levels, however the regulator must be informed of the batteries con- dition to taper the charge and prevent overcharging. This information is supplied to the regulator by the battery counter electromotive force on the regulator. The rate of charge is determined by the voltage lim- iting relay. The higher the battery's charge, the higher the charging voltage must be and the more effect the voltage limiter will have on the charging rate. This reduces the charging rate as the battery comes up to charge.",
    "paragraph5147": "17-24, GENERATOR WARNING LIGHT. The gen- erator warning light is provided to indicate when the generator is not charging the battery. The light is electrically connectedacross the cutout relay contacts of the voltage regulator. Whenever the cutout contacts are open the light will measure the potential difference betweenthe battery and the generator armature, When the battery voltage is in excess of the generator out- put (suchasan idling condition) the light will come on. As the generator speed (output) is increased, the potential difference across the light will diminish and the light will grow dim. When the cutout relay connects the generator output to the battery the light circuit is bypassed through the voltage regulator and the light will go out.",

Although this section outlines repair permis- sible on structure of the various aircraft, the decision of whether to repair or replace a major unit of struc- ture will be influenced by such factors as time and labor available, and by a comparison of labor costs with the price of replacement assemblies. Past ex- perience indicates that replacement, in many cases, is less costly than major repair. Certainly, when the aircraft must be restored to its airworthy condi- tion in a limited length of time, replacement is preferable.",
    "paragraph6726": "19-3. Restoration of a damaged aircraft to its origi- nal design strength, shape and alignment involves careful evaluation of the damage, followed by exact- ing workmanship in performing the repairs. This section suggests the extent of repair practicable on Cessna single-engine aircraft and supplements C.A.M. 18. Consult the factory when in doubt about a repair not specifically mentioned here.",

However, corrosion of all types should be carefully considered, and approved remedial action taken. Small cans appear in the skin structure of all- metal airplanes. It is strongly recommended how- ever, that wrinkles which appear to have originated from other sources, or which do not follow the gen- eral appearance of the remainder of the skin panels, be thoroughly investigated. Wrinkles occurring on open areas which would disappear when the rivet pat~- tern at the edge of the sheet is removed may often be repaired by the addition of a 1/2 x 1/2 x .060-inch 2024-T 4 extruded angle, if riveted over the wrinkle and extended to within 1/16 to 1/8-inch of the nearest structural members. Rivet pattern should be identical to the existing manufactured seam at the edge of the sheet. Wrinkles occurring over stringers which dis- appear when the rivet pattern is removed may be con- sidered negligible. However, the stringer rivet holes may not align themselves perfectly with the skin holes because of a permanent \"set\" in the stringer. If this is apparent, replacement of the stringer will usually restore the original strength characteristics to the area.",

Mild wrinkles oc- curring in the upper or lower skin panels in the bay forward of the horizontal stabilizer and which extend through the corners (shoulder areas) may be repaired by the addition of a stringer. A wrinkle, which is hand removable, should be reinforced by a 1/2 x 1/2 x .050-inch 2024-T4 extruded angle. The angle should be inserted fore and aft across the center of the wrinkle and should extend to within 1/16 to 1/8-inch of the fuselage bulkheads comprising the ends of the bay.

A truss structure, fastened to the fire- wall at four points, supports a cradle arrangement. This cradle arrangement, with its supporting lugs, forms the base for rubber shock mounted engine sup- ports.",
    "paragraph7054": "19-56. GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS. All welding on the engine mount should be of the highest quality since the tendency of vibration is to accentuate any minor defect present and cause fatigue cracks. En- gine mount members are preferably repaired by using a large diameter replacement tube, telescoped over the stub of the original member using fishmouth and rosette type welds. However, reinforced 30-degree scarf welds in place of the fishmouth welds are con- sidered satisfactory for engine mount repair work.",
    "paragraph7055": "19-57, ENGINE MOUNT SUPPORT CRADLE DAMAGE. Minor damage such as a crack adjacent to an engine attaching lug may be repaired by rewelding the cradle tube and extending a gusset past the damaged area. Extensively damaged parts should not be repaired but should be replaced.",

Moderate pres- sure is recommended for best results. Curing time will vary with the agent used, but repairs should not be stressed until fully cured. Cracks can be re- paired by saturating the crack itself with the cohesive, then filling with an epoxy filler or a paste made of Royalite shavings and the cohesive.
