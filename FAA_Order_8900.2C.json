In 2006, Aviation Safety (AVS) published Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Order VS 1100.2, Managing AVS Delegation Programs, which provided direction for the management and oversight of AVS delegation programs, including Flight Standards Service designees. During the next 2 years, the AVS Delegation Steering Group, which included representation from Flight Standards, identified important goals including the integration of Flight Standards designee policy. A Flight Standards working group, including policy holders for each General Aviation (GA) airman designee type, was formed to work on this consolidated order. This order contains integrated procedures for the selection, appointment, oversight, training, renewal, termination, and appeal of Flight Standards GA airman designees in accordance with Order VS 1100.2.",
    "paragraph6": "2. This order contains procedures for authorized GA airman designees and inspectors to conduct certificate holder oral and practical tests and issue Temporary Airman Certificates.",
    "paragraph7": "3. When differences in guidance appear between this order and FAA Order 8900.1, Volume 13, Flight Standards Designees, use the document with the most current revision date. This order also applies to all aviation safety inspectors (ASI) (referred to in this order as ASIs or inspectors) who review and approve airman applications and testing files for GA airman designees.",

    "paragraph166": "Throughout this order, Technical Personnel Examiner (TPE) references will refer to Designated Mechanic Examiners (DME) and Designated Parachute Rigger Examiners (DPRE) collectively. When necessary, DMEs and/or DPREs may be specifically identified if applicable only to that designee type. For the purposes of this order, Designated Pilot Examiners (DPE) will refer to Private Pilot Examiners (PE), Commercial and Instrument Rating Examiners (CIRE), Commercial Pilot Examiners (CE), Airline Transport Pilot Examiners (ATPE), Flight Instructor Examiners (FIE), Pilot Proficiency Examiners (PPE), Specialty Aircraft Examiners (SAE), Sport Pilot Examiners (SPE), Sport Pilot Flight Instructor Examiners (SFIE), Vintage Aircraft Examiners (VAE), Experimental Aircraft Examiners (EAE), Limited Aircraft Examiners (LAE), and Vintage Flight Engineer Examiners (VFEE).

    "paragraph178": "7. Role of the Designee. Designees have been an important part of the FAA’s support to the flying public for over 60 years. During that time, designees successfully completed thousands of certification activities on the FAA’s behalf. The designee function is vital to enhancing the FAA’s public service role and enhancing overall safety in the National Airspace System (NAS). The FAA and its designees are in a symbiotic relationship. The FAA appoints designees to leverage its workforce and provide certification services to the public, and the designee provides certification services to the public in accordance with FAA policy and guidance. One component of this relationship involves how the FAA views the designee, as well as how the designee views the FAA.",

Scenarios, as typically used in flight training, set up a set of circumstances that can be used to teach a specific (canned) response to an in-flight event. For example, an engine failure—pitch for best glide, etc. The method may be effective in teaching a critical response to the single-engine engine failure, but it does not promote the development of critical thinking skills and would not be useful in evaluating them. This example may be effective in evaluating a response to an emergency situation, but it would not allow a designee to observe the SRM skills of an applicant. For a practical test, a scenario is a single mission that is planned and carried out.

The scenario described above has a purpose; that is, to take the applicant and his mother-in-law to his wife’s graduation and the celebration following.

The plan of action must allow the applicant to make a decision on an event or situation that has occurred, the trigger event, and then carry that decision to a logical conclusion. Since malfunctioning equipment, typically, does not repair itself, the airplane must land. For the sake of this discussion, the decision to divert was good and the choice of airports was okay, but not necessarily the best choice.

The designee may need to create and provide additional circumstances that would limit the applicant’s choices. For example, an airport’s runway is closed for repair. This circumstance should be a part of the initial planning factors and should not be a surprise provided during the execution of the diversion.

That person must also comply with the German medical license/endorsement requirements when exercising the privileges of their § 61.75 pilot certificate for the glider rating (refer to § 61.75(e)(3)).",

    "paragraph4562": "rating because the Spanish IMC privilege does not meet the certification standards and qualification for a U.S. instrument rating and confers no privileges for flights requiring compliance with IFR. The Spanish IMC privilege is only authorized for use within Spain. Therefore, the holder of the Spanish IMC privilege is not eligible to take the IFP knowledge test or be issued a U.S. instrument rating.",
    "paragraph4563": "(3) Belgium issues some PPLs with the notation “Restricted.” This limitation restricts the person to Belgian airspace only. This pilot license parallels the U.S. recreational pilot certificate (i.e., the person has not met the cross-country aeronautical experience and training requirements of ICAO). Do not issue a § 61.75 private pilot certificate to a person who holds a Belgian PPL with the notation “Restricted” on it.",

That person must also comply with that night operating restriction of their foreign pilot license when exercising the privileges of their § 61.75 pilot certificate (refer to § 61.75(e)(3)). A point of clarification: the FAA may not remove the night flying restriction. It is permissible for a foreign pilot who receives a U.S. pilot certificate based on his or her foreign pilot license to accomplish the required night flying training (for the appropriate grade level of U.S. pilot certificate held) from a holder of an FAA flight instructor certificate, and to receive a solo endorsement to exercise night flying privileges on his or her U.S. pilot certificate.",

The Proficiency Scale is found in ICAO Document 9835. These definitions apply to any applicant or airman applying for or holding an FAA certificate.",
    "paragraph4766": "A. Pronunciation (P). This assumes that English is not the applicant’s native language and that the applicant has a dialect or accent that is intelligible to the aeronautical community. Pronunciation, stress, rhythm, and intonation are influenced by the applicant’s native language, but only sometimes interfere with ease of understanding.",
    "paragraph4767": "B. Structure (S). Relevant grammatical structures and sentence patterns are determined by language functions appropriate to the task. Basic grammatical structures and sentence patterns are used creatively and are usually well controlled by the applicant. Errors may occur, particularly in unusual or unexpected circumstances, but rarely interfere with meaning.",
    "paragraph4768": "C. Vocabulary (V). The applicant’s vocabulary range and accuracy are usually sufficient to communicate effectively on common, concrete, and work-related topics. The applicant can often paraphrase successfully when lacking vocabulary in unusual or unexpected circumstances.",
    "paragraph4769": "D. Fluency (F). The applicant produces stretches of language at an appropriate tempo. There may be occasional loss of fluency on transition from rehearsed or formulaic speech to spontaneous interaction, but this does not prevent effective communication. The applicant can make limited use of discourse markers or connectors. Fillers are not distracting.",
    "paragraph4770": "E. Comprehension (C). Comprehension by the applicant is mostly accurate on common, concrete, and work-related topics when the dialect, accent, or variety used is sufficiently intelligible. When the applicant is confronted with a linguistic or situational complication or an unexpected turn of events, comprehension may be slower or require clarification strategies.",
    "paragraph4771": "F. Interactions (I). Responses by the applicant are usually immediate, appropriate, and informative. The applicant initiates and maintains exchanges even when dealing with an unexpected turn of events. The applicant deals adequately with apparent misunderstandings by checking, confirming, or clarifying.",
    "paragraph4772": "Note: Reports have determined that an individual referred for an AELS may possess the attributes listed above and be able to communicate using the English language, yet be handicapped during flight in a high-traffic environment (also due to the stress associated with being an inexperienced pilot) because English is their second language.",
