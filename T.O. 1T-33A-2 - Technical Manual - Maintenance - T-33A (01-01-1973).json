    "paragraph93": "1-2. The T-33A is an all-metal, low-wing, two-seat, high performance airplane designed for the training of Air Force flight personnel. (See figures 1-1 through 1-4.) The airplane is powered by a single J33-A-35 turbojet engine, and incorporates a laminar flow wing section, aileron control hydraulic boost mechanism, dive flaps, pressurized and heated cockpit, and wing tip provisions for carrying droppable fuel tanks, bombs, or chemical tanks.",
    "paragraph94": "1-3, T-33A airplanes, having AF Serial No. 49-907 through 49-912, are winterized and differ from the basic airplane as follows: Replacement of “O\" and “V” ring packings with extreme temperature rings; installation of natural rubber canopy seal; and replacement of lubri- cants in Map indicator cables, AN/ARC-3 radio dyna- motor bearings, AN/ARN-G compass tuning shaft and couplings, and in machine guns.",
    "paragraph95": "1-4. The wing is of full cantilever, stressed aluminum- alloy skin construction, made in one unit. Wing lead- ing edge sections, wing tips, ailerons, and flaps are detachable. Interior structure consists of two maia beams, and one auxiliary beam for attachment of ailerons and split-type flaps. Space is also provided for installation of fuel tanks, oxygen cylinders, and attachment and enclosure of the main alighting gears. Wing flaps are installed to increase lift and drag. Ailerons are con- ventional and are controlled by lateral motion of a control stick. A torque tube transmits motion of the stick to the aileron hydraulic booster mechanism which augments force applied by the pilot. A system of cables actuates the ailerons.",
    "paragraph96": "1-5. The fuselage seructure is of alumipum-alloy con- struction, buile in three sections: nose, mid section and aft section. The mid and aft sections are easily sep- arable at station 277.5 -i- 12 to accommodate the power plant installation, A fuel tank is installed in the mid section immediately aft of the cockpit, The cockpit is covered by a transparent, jettisonable, plastic canopy of the “free blown” type. Two jettisonable pilots’ seats are installed in the cockpit. A heating, cooling, and pressurization system is installed for providing the proper amount of air at a controllable temperature. Two hydraulically operated dive recovery Maps are incor- porated in the bottomvof the fuselage at approximately station 164 -4 26.",
    "paragraph97": "AND LEADING PARTICULARS",

During initial movement of the piston rod, the gear does not move as the side struts are on dead-center position. Instead, the force is trans- formed into rotation of the crank connected to the other end of the cylinder. The crank actuates the down lock mechanism and releases the lock. After the down Jock is released, additional force applied through the crank to the down lock mechanism breaks the side struts from dead-center position, thus permitting re- traction of the gear. Extension of the gear is essentially a reversal of this operation. For further details on oper- ation of the down lock, refer to paragraph 4-169,",

The doors for each main gear consist of an inner segment hinged parallel to the airplane center line, a center segment attached to the shock-strut lower end, and an outer segment hinged on the wing and connected to the shock strut by a spring- joaded actuator rod. The inner door segment is hydrau- lically operated by an actuating cylinder and mechanical linkage, in automatic sequence with the gear operation, A separate hydraulic actuating cylinder is installed for emergency release of the inner door segment.",
    "paragraph2503": "4-212, OPERATION OF MAIN GEAR DOORS AND UPLOCK MECHANISM. (See figure 4-41.) The center and outer door segments move with the gear to their closed positions before the inner door segment closes. During retraction, a hook on the center door engages a roller on the outer door to lock the two segments in a flush position when completely closed. This se- quence in closing operation is due to a mechanical delay provided by the inner-segment actuating linkage. When the gear has nearly reached its retracted position, lever (12) is struck by the center door segment. This moves rod (10) to force a link over dead-center position. Hydraulic pressure in the door cylinder (5) is prevented from moving the door by dead-center position of link (14), thus, when the link has moved from dead-center, the cylinder is free to swing the door to closed position. Upon closing, a roller (17) mounted on the door first contacts retainer hook (16) and moves the hook slighty inboard. This action relieves the cylinder force on trig- ger hook (15) at its notched end, and frees both hooks to rotate as further force by the cylinder moves them onte the roller, Whea up and locked, the doors serve to lock the gear in retracted position.",
    "paragraph2504": "4-213. In opening, inner door and gear extension are almost simultaneous. As soon as the door actuating cyl- inder releases the uplock and starts the inner door to opening, the weight of the gear as it extends helps to force the door open. Emergency opening of the inner door segment is effected by a smail release cylinder (11) which rotates the hooks to their normal open position. When rotated to the open positions, the hooks parti- ally open the door, The door is then forced completely open by the gear as it extends.",

The struts then pull the gear aft and up into the wheel weil, where it is locked by the up lock mechanism. Extension of the gear is essentially a reversal of the retracting operation.

Air enters the ducts through two faired scoops, one on each side of the fuselage, for- ward of the wing leading-edge. Each scoop contains ducts and louvres for venting overboard the inboard intake boundary layer air.",
    "paragraph3753": "4-314, During ground operation of the power plant, air is admitted to the engine compressor openings through two auxiliary air inlet doors. These doors are spring- loaded to keep them closed during flight. Differential air pressure across the engine compartment and fuselage exterior during ground operation overcomes the spring force to open the doors.",
    "paragraph3754": "4-315. Air entering the intake scoops or ground operat- ing doors is dumped into the engine compartment where it enters the compressor, A seal around the engine pe- tiphery prevents loss of intake air through the fuselage aft section.",
    "paragraph3755": "4-316. AIR INTAKE DUCT. (See figure 4-67.) The intake ducts are constructed of aluminum alloy sheet metal, with a beaded outer skin. Hat-section stiffeners on the inboard sides of the ducts serve to strengthen the structure. The ducts extend from fuselage station 163.875 to station 228.30.

The air is compressed and forced out through the diffusers and air adapters inte the com- bustion chambers. Each combustion chamber consists of an outer wall and an inner perforated liner. The com- pressed air is forced between the outer wali and inner liner and through the perforations into the interior of the chamber. The compressed air admitted to the inner chamber is mixed with fuel from the fuel nozzle, and burned. The exhaust gases pass through the turbine wheel. The turbine wheel is directly connected to the impeller, and drives the impeller and the accessories. The gases leaving the turbine wheel enter the exhaust cone and the tail pipe. The exhaust cone consists of a short tapered pipe covering an inner cone. Ie contains four fins to straighten the flow of gas as the gas leaves the turbine wheel.",

The motor relay shorts out the current limiting resistor and impresses full bus power on the motor. At this instant maximum current flows through the series relay, closing it. After the series relay has closed, the starter switch may be allowed to return to neutral, turn- ing off the control citeuit, and current from the bas will hotd the accelerating relay and motor relay closed.

The gang start airstart switch installed by T.O. 1T-33A- 593 supplements and overrides the existing fuel and engine control switches, The circuit for this switch is a pottion of the emergency aitstart and ignition circuit {see figure 8-36A.) It is composed of momentary aft and forwatd gang start switches; gang start indicators (amber lights), ignition time delay relay, forward de- icing switch, aft and forward airstart engine ignition switches, airstart relay junction box, forward fuel se- quence switch and circuit breakers. Actuating the gang start switches to their ON positions will simultanecusly actuate the airstart ignition system, gang load the fuel booster pumps, turn the starting fuel ON in the auto- matic position, switch to the emergency fuel system and actuate the fuel de-icing system for approximately 45 seconds through the airstart ignition time delay relay. Once the gang start switches are actuated to their ON positions (indicated by the amber lights) all items con- trolled by these switches, except the airstart ignition and the fuel de-icing system, will remain ON until the gang start switches are momentarily depressed to their OFF positions. On airplanes incorporating T.O. 1T-33A-608, the gang start indicator light assembly, MS25041-4, which has been installed by T.O. 1T-33A-593 in both cockpits, is replaced with the AN3157-4 light assembly to eliminate any inadvertent actuation of the gang start system caused by the internal failure of the former light assembly, On airplanes that contain MS$25331-8 light assembly, T.O. 1T-33A-608 converts the assembly to MS25331-4 configuration by installing the dimmable amber lens in lieu of the non-dimmable amber lens,",

Each side of the wing incorporates two inboard tanks, two outboard tanks, and a leading edge tank. The leading cdge and both outboard tanks are interconnected, and the two inboard tanks are interconnected, A fuel tank is installed in the fuselage immediately aft of the cock- pit. Provision is, made for attachment of a droppable tank to each wing tip. Fuel is forced from the drop- pable tanks by air pressure supplied by the engine compressor. It is pumped from the wing tanks by elec- tically operated booster pumps, one located at the root of each leading edge tank, and one in the root of each aft inboard tank, Fuel is normally supplied to the engine from the fuselage tank, and, as the supply is depleted in this tank, is continuously replenished from the drop- pable tanks, and wing tanks,",

When the fuel level in the fuselage tank drops to the level of the upper float valve this opens and fuel is forced from the droppable tanks to the fuselage tank, When the droppable tanks are emptied, a pressure switch operates an indicator fight adjacent to the control switches to show that the dreppable tanks are empty. Additional lowering of the fuselage-tank fuel level opens the middie float valve to permit delivery of fuel from the leading edge tank, prior to AF Serial No. $3-4886, and from the inboard tanks, AF Serial No. 53-4886 and subsequent, to the fuselage task. Upon transfer of all fuel from these tanks to the fuselage tank, a pressure switch operates a warning light indi- cating that the transfer of fuel has been completed. The leading-edge-tank fuel pumps, prior to AF Serial No. 53-4886, and the inboard tank pumps on AF Serial No. 53-4886 and subsequent, should be shut down at this time to reduce the electrical load. The indicator light will then tura off. When the fuel level in the fuselage tank reaches and opens the lewest floac valve, fuel is transferred from the inboard tanks, prior to AF Serial No. 53-4886, and from the leading edge tanks on AF Serial No. 53-4886 and subsequent.

The pilot valve is actuated by the float. When the fuel level is sufficiently high, the pilot valve is closed, and fuel pressure applied to the bottom sur- face of the main-valve rubber diaphragm through bleed holes in the main-valve stem keeps the main valve closed. When the fuel level drops, the pilot valve opens to re- lieve the pressure on the bottom surface of the rubber diaphragm, A ball check in the main valve is actuated by the pilot-valve stem. When the pilot valve opens, the ball check closes off pressure to the bottom of the rubber diaphragm. Fuel is then admitted to the fuselage tank through the valves. Note",

The bypass valve regulates the amount of fuel returned to the engine dual pump inlet to maintain a constant pressure drop from the control inlet to the high-pressure side of the control cutoff vaive..This pressure drop is used by the regulator and governor valve to meter the fuel passing through the main fuel control to the engine. The maximum pressure relief valve in the bypass valve prevents buildup of excessive pressure.",
    "paragraph5125": "4-494, The fuel is supplied to the regulator unit at a pressure determined by the bypass valve. The centrifugal regulator unit adjusts the fuel pressure suppfied to the control unit and governor valve in response to variations of engine speed. This is accomplished by applying the thrust from centrifugal regulator weights to a linkage to which are connected the regulator valve and the metering head diaphragm. This thrust is opposed by the fuel pressure on the metering head diaphragm which is tending to close the regulator valve, The regulator valve regulates fuel flow by balancing these forces.",
    "paragraph5126": "4-495. Fuel, at a pressure proportional to engine speed, passes from the regulator unit, through the governor valve in the fuel control, and out through the cutoff valve to the engine fuel manifold. The centrifugal governor valve is the prime control of fuel supplied to the engine. The pilot selects the desired engine speed by positioning the auxiliary fuel contro! lever through the engine control lever in the cockpit, For",

    "paragraph5128": "each auxiliary control lever position, a definite spring force is set up, tending to open the governor valve. Likewise, for every engine speed, there is a definite thrust force supplied by the governor valve centrifugal speec-controlling weights tending to close the governor valve. The governor valve will seek a position which allows the fuel flow to increase engine speed uatif the thrust force from the centrifugal governor weights equals the spring force. The governor waive then will meter fuel so as to maintain the constant engine speed selected by the auxiliary fuel control lever.",
    "paragraph5129": "4-496, The governor valve is against the maximum flow stop whenever the engine speed is below the pre- selected value, and likewise, it is against the minimum flow stop when the opposite is true. Thus, with a meter. ing head across the governor valve being maintained by the regulator (proportional to engine speed during ac- celeration) the condition of maximum governors valve opening gives a fuel flow proportional to engine speed.",
    "paragraph5130": "4-497, Altitude compensation of fuel pressure in the main fuel control body is provided by the action of a fuel differential pressure-actuated diaphragm in the metering chamber. The centrifugal fuel pressure regu- later valve is linked to this diaphragm. Fuel is admitted to the metering chamber through two fixed jets in the diaphragm, and differential pressure across the dia- phragm is controlied by the position of a contoured needle in the metering chamber outlet. The position of the contoured needle is controlled -by the barometric fuel control which consists of an oil and gas filled bellows which expands when atmospheric pressure at the engine compressor inlet drops, and contracts when the same pressure rises. When the beliows expands (as alti- tude increases), it moves the contoured needle out of the metering chamber outlet jet, thereby increasing the out- let area. Since the metering chamber inlet area is fixed, this causes a pressure drop in the chamber. This pressure drop causes the diaphtagm to deflect. Since the dia- phragm is linked to the centrifugal pressure regulator valve, this deflection moves the valve toward che closed position. This lowers the pressure in the main fuel control chamber, and hence at the centrifugal governor valve through which fuel is delivered to the engine. At very high altitudes, with the engine control lever in the idie position, the pressute differential across the metering diaphragm is sufficient to close the centrifugal pressure regulator valve completely. Fuel then passes from the relief valve chamber only through the fixed altitude-idle jet.",

It is located forward of access panel No, 32. The valve is connected to a drain mani- fold which, in turn, is connected to the seven. lowest combustion chambers, namely, No. $ to 11 inclusive. The upper combustion chambers drain internally to com- bustion chambers No, $ and 11. The valve is designed to open and allow fuel to drain into the atmosphere when fuel pressure within the combustion chamber falls below 2 psi gage pressure, When raw fuel collects in the air adapters during a false start, or when the engine is stopped, it must be drained before another start is at- tempted. ‘The chamber-drain manifold and combustion chamber drain valve automatically perform this draining function, thereby preventing a “hot start.”",

These are mounted on a triangular casting which is bolted to the wing rear beam with three bolts. The unit is con- nected to the control stick by means of torque tubes and push rods. (See figure 4-112.) The control valve; which is actuated by a mechanical linkage connected to the aileron torque tube, directs hydraulic pressure to either side of the actuating cylinder. A low-boost-catio spring cartridge on the booster unit reduces stick sensitivity at low control-surface loads, particularly near neutral position. When aileron loads are sufficient to cause complete compression of the spring, the booster operates as described in paragraph 4-600. If hydraulic system pressure drops to approximately 250 psi, the bypass valve on the actuating cylinder opens to connect the two ends of the cylinder, thereby permitting manual operation of the ailerons. Access to the booster unit is through the engine compartment lower access doors Nos. 65 and 66,",

Motion of the elevator operating arm actuates the tab horns through a link and bell crank, and simultaneously tends to compress -the spring in‘ the spring assembly. If the elevator air load is less than the compression value, of the spring assembly, force is transmitted through the spring assembly to the elevator horn and bracket, thus operating the elevators and spring tab simultaneously. If elevator air loads exceed the compression value of the spring assembly, continued motion of the elevator oper- ating arm gradually compresses the spring and operates the tabs until the tabs deflect enough to develop the necessary boost to the elevator controls, If elevator air loads are strong enough to compress the spring fully, jam nuts engage the yoke, and stick pressure is trans- mitted directly to the elevator horns.",

When dive flap or alighting gear selector valve is operated, flow in basic system pressute line is temporarily checked by poppet (9) but acts upon sampling piston (7), causing small volume behind piston to flow to actuating cylinder. This small volume of fluid causes a like amount of fluid to flow out of actuating cylinder, through return line to act upon piston (4). This opens poppet (9), allowing basic system pressure to flow directly through fuse. If line to or from actuating cylinder has been broken, original sample fluid would have been lost and not available to act upon piston (4), thus leaving poppet (9) closed and preventing any further loss of fluid. A reset handle on cockpit left shelf acts as an override control for the fuse. If either alight- ing geat or dive flap system should fail to operate due to “fusing,” selector valve should be returned to oppo- site position, and reset handle pushed down momentarily to reset fuse.

In most of these instances, other defects are responsible for the apparent inability of generator to function properly for lack of residual magnetism. A peculiar characteristic that often serves to strengthen the theory of lost residual magne- tism is the fact that flashing the field of a generator will restore its output in a majority of cases in which the generator was inoperative due to other causes. For this reason it is essential that a thorough inspection be made prior to flashing the field of a generator that appears in normal condition but is not capable of self-excitation. Laxity in this respect will invariably result in the need to flash the generator field at every engine run-up, This is undesirable as continuous flashing of the generator field can cause permanent damage to generator. Further- more, conditions will undoubtedly be overlooked that can only become progressively worse and may eventually lead to failure of generator in flight.

    "paragraph7826": "The AIMS system automatically provides identification of a target airplane and its altitude through a multiple pulse coded reply, transmitted in response fo an appropriately coded interrogation. The coded reply, processed by the interrogation equipment provides a visual indication on a radarscope of target airplane identification {in modes 1,2, 3/A, 4 and test) and altitude (in mode C). Since the sys- tem has the mode 4 (encrypted) IFF capability, it is desig- nated as a Mark XII system. The system's auxiliary func- tions are identification-of-position (I/P), emergency, and mode C special position identification (SPI). In the I/P function, the pilot initiates a modified reply code which allows the interrogating station to identify his airplane in a group of airplanes, The emergency function is also initi- ated by the pilot and provides a coded reply to an interro- gation which readily identifies the airplane as being in distress, The emergency function is initiated automatically if the pilot ejects from the airplane. The SPI function in mode C automatically provides an indication which allows an air traffic controller to quickly identify all airplanes above or below a specific altitude. The AIMS system is capable of self-test in modes 1,2, 3/A, and C. External inputs to the system are provided by the TACAN system and by the microphone and tone control circuits in the UHF radio system. AIMS system operation is mhibited in all modes by blanking pulses provided by the TACAN sys- tem during transmission.",
    "paragraph7827": "The control panel, located in the sub-instrument panel in the forward cockpit, provides controls and indications for operation, monitoring, and in-flight testing of the sys- tem. Controls on the panel include a MASTER switch; mode select and test switches for modes 1,2, 3/A and C; and an identifier pulse switch. Mode 4 enable and code select switches are also on the contro! panel. The MASTER switch controls system turn-on, receiver sensitivity (normal or low) and emergency operation. The mode and test se- lect switches (M—1,M—2,M--3/A and M--C) provide a means of selecting the mode of operation by placing the appropriate switch at ON. These switches also provide a means of initiating a self-test of each mode by placing and holding the appropriate switch at TEST. The TEST light ptovides an indication of proper system performance in each mode. Mode 4 is selected by placing the MODE 4 switch at ON. The mode I and mode 3/A code selectors",
    "paragraph7828": "are thimbwheel-type switches. The two mode | code se- Iectors provide for 32 code selections, and the four mode 3/A code selectors provide for 4096 code selections. The mode 2 code selectors are on the front panel of the re- ceiver-transmitter. Mode 4 codes are set in the mode 4 computer using a code changer key. The mode 4 code se- lector, on the control panel, provides a means of enabling either code A or B, a means of retaining the code for an additional flight (code is automatically returned to zero when power is removed after landing), as well as providing ameans of manually zeroizing the mode 4 code. The RAD- TEST-OUT-MON switch, when placed at MON, provides a means of monitoring receiver-transmitter replies to external interrogations in modes 1,2, 3/A,or C. When the switch is held at TEST, the two test modes are enabled and will reply to external interrogations. The IDENT-OUT-MIC (identifier pulse) switch enables transmission of aircraft L/P signals for about 30 seconds when switch is momentarily placed at IDENT or when switch is at MIC position and the MIC but- ton on the throttle is momentarily depressed. This allows the interrogation station to identify a specific airplane in a group. The AUDIO-OUT-LIGHT switch completes the group for the mode 4 REPLY light when positioned at AUDIO or LIGHT.

Each inhalation port contains an inlet check valve which allows a fresh supply of oxygen to flow to the interior of the mask only when it is needed by the user, During exhalation the check valves are closed. An exhalation valve located at the base of the mask in the exhalation port dispels the exhaled ait through the expiratory chamber. During the inhaling process the exhalation valve remains closed. If the mask does not fit, the user will draw some ait from the rare- fied atmosphere instead of drawing the correct amount of oxygen from the regulator, and will suffer from the effects of too little oxygen. Extreme care must be taken, therefore, in fitting the mask. A flexible corrugated tube connects the mask to the demand systea:.",

It is of the two stage reduction type, consisting of two main sections or stages and a mixing chamber. The low pressure chamber contains a relief valve which will “crack” at a minimam of 1.1 inch of mercury, In addition to furnishing oxygen on demand the A-14 regulator mixes air with oxygen in varying quantities according to existing altitudes. Two manual controls, the diluter control and the pressure breathing knob are provided. ‘The two positions of the diluter con- trol are labeled NORMAL OXYGEN and 100% OXY- GEN.

As soon as inhalation stops, a spring returns the diaphragm to its original position and valve (4) closes.",
    "paragraph10081": "4-1246. When the diluter control handle is in the NOR- MAL position the regulator automatically provides the required amount of oxygen, This is accomplished by an aneroid within the regulator which controls an oxygen port and an air port, As altitude creases, the aneroid expands, gradually closing the ais port while opening the oxygen port, so that at approximately 30,000 feet the air port is completely closed and the oxygen port wide open. When the diluter control handle is tarned to 100% OXYGEN position, the regulator still functions as a demand regulator, but the air port is closed and 100 percent pure oxygen is supplied at all altitudes. The ptessure breathing knob must be turned to the successive positions as altitude is increased above 30,000 feet. The knob should be set to SAFETY at altitudes between",

There is no ammun- ition cookoff hazard when bolt is opened with gun charg- er. Vent openings are provided to prevent gas concen- tration, Pods can be installed or removed in approximate- ly ten minutes by two men. No special tools or ground support equipment is required. Electrical power require- ments are 15 amps, 28V DC. Firing of guns is initiated from the stick trigger (28 volts). Chargers operate on six amps per pod, 28 V DC, and are protected with a special four amp slo blo fuse located on the junction box in each gun pod. This fuse should be replaced only with a like item. A higher amperage fuse will damage the gun charger motor if a gun jam occurs due to a defective cartridge or link. Push button switches are also provided on the gun pod junction box for operating the gun chargers during ground maintenance. The modified M37 gun weigh 26 Ibs. each, and are 41-5/8 inches long.
